Project has two main functionalities, create & initialize account is one and login & recalibrate is the other
getValidX methods ensure that the program receives appropriate user input whenever the user is asked to provide some
display methods show the menus that help the user navigate through the program
calorie calculators use set formulae based on the parameters the user provided to come up with a recommendation
createUser populates the user object on registration, getUser populates it from file upon login, storeUser saves it to the Accounts.txt file
recalibrationSequence is the main method of the login part, it calls all the calculator functions and provides appropriate messages based on the user's previous and current inputs
Tests folder contains unit tests for the majority of the methods 
Constants file contains all messages, permanents mins & maxes etc (Do not alter it)
